        Prior to my studies at Geoscience I studied Chemistry for two years, 
        and it was here I found my interest in water – which prompted the change from Chemistry to Geoscience. 
        My completed courses reflect this interest in water, as I have chosen courses that have given me experience in how to use GIS for mapping, 
        MODFLOW for groundwater molding and PhreeqC to do calculations of water samples.
      </p>
      <p class="resume-box-p">
        I highly enjoy working in the field and solve problems. 
        I am certain my analytic approach will be very helpful in solving any type of water related issues as they are presented during the course. 
        Furthermore, I enjoy working in groups as I find that well-functioning teams often end up with a better solution to any given problem. 
        I can contribute with my knowledge from my completed courses, but also the state-of-the-art knowledge from my master thesis.
